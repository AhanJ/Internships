            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Eiffel Tower is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world. It is located in Paris, France, and was named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.
            </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance arch for the 1889 World's Fair, the Eiffel Tower was initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design. However, it has become a global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world.
            </p>
            <h2>Specifications</h2>
            <p>
                The Eiffel Tower is 324 meters (1,063 feet) tall, about the same height as an 81-story building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 meters (410 feet) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930.
