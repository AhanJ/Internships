/* Fixed Positioning: The position: fixed property positions the .header element relative to the viewport. This means that the .header will stay in the same position on the screen, regardless of scrolling. 

The .header element with position: fixed is positioned relative to the viewport and not the containing block. It doesn't contribute to the height of its parent container (in this case, the <body>), which can lead to the body having no apparent width if there are no other block-level elements inside it.

Full Width: The width: 100% property ensures that the .header element spans the entire width of the viewport. This makes the header stretch across the screen from the left edge to the right edge. */
